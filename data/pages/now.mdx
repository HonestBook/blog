# I WANT TO BE HIRED.

If you are interested in hiring me, you can learn more about me on the [About](about) page.

On a lighter note, I totally do not mind being unemployed for a while.  
As long as I am constantly improving myself, getting a job late only means getting a better job.  
_Therefore, you really should consider hiring me when I am in the earlier stages of growing._

# Goals for 2023 I am Working on

- Read 23 Books
- Write 10 technical blogs
- Get a job
- Have abs
- Run a 10K

You can read more about all my goals for 2023 on my dedicated [post](blog/goals-2023).

## Books I am Reading

- _Why We Sleep_ by Matthew Walker
- _The Pragmatic Programmer_ by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas
- _Hooked_ by Nir Eyal
- _The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ by Douglas Adams
- 《演员的自我修养》斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基

## Technologies I am Learning

- Next.js, React, TailWindCSS for this site
- Rust with Tauri for building desktop applications
- Docker and Kubernetes

## Habits I am Trying to Build

- Have a better posture when using the computer
- Read RSS Feeds rather than randomly scrolling through my phone
- Press the _P_ key with my little finger
- Use Obsidian for note taking.

## This is a [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about)

If you have your own site, you should make one, too.

Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) for the inspiration.
