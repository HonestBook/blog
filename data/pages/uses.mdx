# My Laptop

My laptop for virtually EVERYTHING is Lenovo Legion R7000.

- CPU: AMD R5-4600H
- GPU: GTX1650Ti 4GB
- RAM: 16GB
- OS: Windows 10

I definitely do NOT recommend using Windows for development though.  
I am looking to make the switch to a UNIX based OS.

# Software

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Vim extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) with [Vimium extension](https://vimium.github.io/)

In short words, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND using Vim. It has made development more FUN and efficient for me.

- [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/)
  A simple yet powerful tool to look up files on Windows.

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  A very nice markdown editor. I use it for daily journaling and note taking.

- [Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox)
  An application launcher. I use it as a Windows alternative to the MacOS app [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).
  It can also run commands as a command prompt. This is exceptionally handy as it remembers command history.

I also use other softwares of course, but I do not reckon they are worth mentioning.
