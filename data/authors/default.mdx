## Why Shuyun?

Shuyun, 书云 in Chinese, literally translates to book cloud, it keeps the "book" part of my
real name, signaling my love for reading.

There was a time that I wanted a pitiful amout of anonymity on the internet. So I used Shuyun
rather than Shumeng.

At the moment, I also have an interest in cloud technologies, but this is purely coincidental.
This name originates from my friend's mother misremembering my name.

## Why the Wallfacer?

It is a reference to the [Three Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest),
which is the single most influential book/series to my life.

The wallfacers' job is to devise a plan to defeat the aliens (known as Trisolarans), despite
the Trisolarans have complete information about their every move, except their thoughts.

The most iconic characteristics of the wallfacers to me, are deep-thinking and far-sightedness.
And I hope I live up to them.

# My avatar

It is definitely not my best picture, but it is my favourtie one because it is
a tribute to the _semi_-retirement pose of my favourite Esport player [Ame](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Ame).

<img src="/static/images/about/ame-retirement.jpg" width="300" height="300" />

Which itself is a [tribute](/static/images/about/inflame.jpeg) to his career guide and close friend [Inflame](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Inflame).

I wish to perform to my best and spread positive vibes as he did in his career.
