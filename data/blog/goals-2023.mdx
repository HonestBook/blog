# Goals

- **Get a job**  
  Self-explanatory.
- **Have a girlfriend**  
  Self-explanatory.
- **Read 23 books**  
  Last year I set the goal of 22 books but ended up finishing only 6. I will try really hard this year.
  May my Kindle be with me.
- **Learn to ride a bicycle**  
  That's right, I don't know how to write a bike yet.
- **Complete a 10K run**  
  I want to run a marathon in the future, so let's start with a 10K.
- **Have abs**  
  Pretty sure my future girlfriend will appreciate this.
- **Reach 1600 on Chess.com Rapid or Blitz**  
  Currently 1400 Rapid and 1100 Blitz.
- **Reach 1800 on Codeforces**  
  Currently 1400.
- **Have a WCA 3x3 blindfold average**  
  I would like to be able to perform a blindfold solve on demand.
  It's always embarassing for me to say I don't know how to do a blind solve considering my efforts into cubing.
- **Travel to a new country**  
  Probably an European country.
- **Learn a language to B2 level**  
  The easiest for me would be Japanese. However, it could also be French, Korean, Spanish, or any other language.
  Definitely not German though.
- **Upload a video to Youtube or Bilibili**  
  The video should be properly edited, which ought to take a lot of efforts. That's why this one is loose on quantity.
- **Have more than 200 days on GitHub timeline**  
   In the process of looking through 200 technical blogs, whenever I see another person with a greenish GitHub timeline, my mind goes "that's damn impressive!"  
   I want my timeline to be green too.
  {/* <!-- TODO edit the link here after posting the blog--> */}
- **Write 10 technical blogs**

  > The best way to learn something is to teach it.

  This is the inspiration behind documenting my tech learning experience.

- **Build 2 more branches on my website**  
  They can be food, reading, gaming, sports, art or whatever I find interesting in 2023.
- **Get 3 more AWS Certificates**  
  I got my first AWS certificate in 2022, the three I want to get in 2023 are:

  - AWS Certified Developer - Associate
  - AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate
  - and AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional.

  This might sound crazy but I enjoy taking certification exams.
