# Learn Next.js

https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs

Very good

0. Install Node.js
1. Look through a starter template, I recommend
   https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog
   this is also what I used for this site.
   Follow the Quick Start Guide in README.md
   And give a thorough reading for the entire README.md.

2. Deploy the website to a hosting platform
   I recommend either Vercel or Netlify.
3. Register a domain name
   You can use the service provided by the hosting platform.
   However I did use Route 53 on AWS.
