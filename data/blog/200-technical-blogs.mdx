# TODO finish this post

# Motivation

I want to start a blog myself. My previous experience with WordPress is not good.
All I knew is that I want have a blog where I have a high degree of control of everything displayed.
But I did not know what framework/tech stack I use.

# Technology stack

# Choose the framework

## Next.js vs. Gatsby.js

A typical blog is more of a static site, the content is not updated frequently.
However, I want to display some 3rd-party data on my website. e.g. My GitHub history, Goodreads status etc.
The way to achieve is to incorporate [Server-side Rendering](TODO) , and that is exactly where Next.js shines.

## Factors to consider

How often are updates made to the site?

Next.js is more dynamic.
Gatsby needs to rebuild the website every time an update is made.

Gatsby uses pre-rendering whereas Next.js uses server-side rendering.

## Other options

# Choose the hosting platform

This video is old but it put Zeit (now Vercel) in a very place.
The question is Netlify now supports Next.
How does Next on Netlify compares with Vercel?

# Choose the post format

Next.js tutorial uses markdown files with metadata at beginning of a file.
Because it requires manual efforts to manage and parse the metadata using JavaScript. It feels like a sub-optimal solution.

Fortunately, some good sites I looked through are open-source. And I learnt they often use MDX.
So this is what I'm going for.

farzadyz uses MDX

## Intersting stuff

A lot of them are using Mastodon over Twitter.
