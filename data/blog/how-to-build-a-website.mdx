# The tech stack and deployment options

I will be using Next.js and I strongly believe that is probably the best option for you.
To learn why, check out my experience of [looking through 200 technical blogs]().

# Learn Next.js

https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs

Very good

0. Install Node.js
1. Look through a starter template, I recommend
   https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog
   this is also what I used for this site.
   Follow the Quick Start Guide in README.md
   And give a thorough reading for the entire README.md.

2. Deploy the website to a hosting platform
   I recommend either Vercel or Netlify.
3. Register a domain name
   You can use the service provided by the hosting platform.
   However I did use Route 53 on AWS.

# Deployment: Netlify

# Options: Customizations you can do to the site

To customise, probably you need to do the learn nextjs site.

# SEO

## Track site data

## Vercel offers built-in Analytics

As of Feb 2023, this is a FREE service in BETA.

## Netlify charges 9 dollars per month

## Customise Analytics with Google Analytics

I met an issue described at

Modify Content Script Policy

## Create sitemap

https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/crawling-and-indexing/xml-sitemaps
// TODO create my sitemap
include Now, About and Uses in sitemap

## Use meaningful routes

## Create a NOW page

This can be featured on NOWNOWNOW.com and is a great [backlink]

# Extra Tip: isolate site management and content creation.
